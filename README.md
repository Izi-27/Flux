AI Agent Orchestration Platform 

A platform to deploy and manage autonomous AI agents for on-chain operations. MVP is a yield-farming agent that automatically moves funds to the highest-yielding opportunities on Polygon.



The Core Concept Broken Down



1. The Problem:



· DeFi is full of lucrative opportunities, but they change every minute.

· Manually moving funds to chase the best yields is time-consuming, slow, and requires expert knowledge.

· Most people miss out on the best returns because they can't monitor and act on the market 24/7.



2. Our Solution:

An AI Agent Orchestration Platform. In simple terms, it's a self-operating profit-seeking system.



· It Monitors: Our backend constantly scans the entire Polygon DeFi landscape (Aave, Quickswap, etc.) for the highest yields.

· It Decides: Using a smart algorithm, it calculates the most profitable move, including the cost of gas.

· It Executes: It automatically and securely moves the funds to the new, higher-yielding opportunity.

· It Repeats: This process runs in a continuous loop, forever optimizing the user's portfolio.



What the User Experiences



A user comes to our platform and:



1. Connects their wallet and deposits funds into a secure, specialized "Agent Vault" (a smart contract).

2. Clicks "Start Agent" on a strategy (e.g., "USDC Yield Optimizer").

3. Our backend takes over. The user can now close the browser. The agent is working.

4. The user can check a simple dashboard anytime to see their current balance, profits earned, and a log of all the actions the agent has taken.



The Bigger Vision (Where This is Headed)



The yield-farming agent is just our starting point—it proves the system works. Once we have the core "orchestration" platform built, we can create an entire ecosystem:



· An "Agent Store": Users could deploy different pre-built agents, like an NFT arbitrage agent, a liquidity provider agent, or a token-trading agent.

· A Marketplace: Eventually, developers could build and sell their own agent strategies on our platform.



Immediate Priority: Wave 1 Goal



Objective: Basic backend that can fetch yields and interact with testnet.



Your Deliverables:



· NestJS project setup with Polygon RPC connection

· DeFiLlama API integration to fetch APYs from 3+ protocols

· Basic decision algorithm to identify highest yield

· Transaction relayer that can interact with testnet contracts

· PostgreSQL setup with basic schema for agent data



Success Metric: Backend can autonomously fetch yield data and be ready to execute when our smart contract is deployed.
